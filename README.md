# Machine Learning

In this repository I will reveal my practice work on the assignments from ["Machine Learning"](https://class.coursera.org/ml-005/lecture "Video Lectures"), an online course led by Andrew Ng, 
Associate Professor from Stanford University.

I do this unofficially, without enrolling. Therefore, only descriptions of the assignments alongside with my own solutions will be placed here.
For the details about the course itself, please, visit the [official page](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning "Machine Learning").
